1. Established a Robust Data Ingestion and Transformation Pipeline:

    Data Sourcing: Successfully fetched data from three distinct financial sources for analysis.

    Data Format & Storage: Parquetized raw data into an optimized columnar format.

    ELT & Warehousing: Performed ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) processes, loading data into a DuckDB data warehouse.

    Data Transformation: Executed SQL transformations within the DuckDB warehouse, creating three staging models and two mart models.

    Data Quality Assurance: Implemented dbt test to validate data integrity in the warehouse, ensuring data quality.

2. Automated Workflow Orchestration:

    DAG Creation: Developed a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with four distinct tasks (fetch, parquetize, dbt run, and dbt test) to automate the data pipeline, running successfully.

3. Interactive Data Visualization:

    Dashboard Development: Created a Streamlit dashboard to visualize and interact with your cleaned and transformed data.

4. Real-time Data Processing with Kafka and Flink:

    Kafka Integration: Successfully set up a Kafka broker using Docker Compose, including the creation of a raw_events topic to serve as a real-time data stream.

    Flink Environment Setup: Configured and deployed a Flink cluster (JobManager and TaskManager) using Docker Compose, ensuring proper communication and resource allocation.

    Flink Job Development: Developed a Flink streaming job (StreamingJob.java) to consume real-time messages from the raw_events Kafka topic.

    Project Build Automation: Manually created a pom.xml to manage dependencies and build the Flink application, overriding previous Maven archetype issues.

    "Fat JAR" Creation: Successfully compiled the Flink application, packaging it and all its dependencies into a single, executable "fat JAR" using Maven's shade plugin.

    Real-time Consumption and Processing: Successfully deployed the Flink job to the Flink cluster, enabling it to actively read and process messages from Kafka, with preliminary output verification in TaskManager logs.


To do list: 

You're right to question the direct connection! While setting up Kafka and Flink is valuable experience, for this specific financial data project, we need to integrate them purposefully. The current Flink job just prints messages, which doesn't directly feed into your existing data warehouse.

Here's how we can make Kafka and Flink relevant to your financial data pipeline:

Integrating Kafka and Flink into Your Financial Data Pipeline ðŸ“Š
The key is to leverage Kafka for real-time data ingestion and Flink for real-time processing and enrichment before data lands in your DuckDB warehouse or feeds your Streamlit dashboard.

We can achieve this by introducing real-time streams for transactional data, market data, or operational logs related to your financial analysis.

1. Real-time Ingestion of Financial Data ðŸš€
Instead of fetching all data in batches (as implied by your current DAG's "fetch" task), we can use Kafka as a streaming buffer for new, incoming financial events.

Example Use Cases:

Real-time Trades/Transactions: Imagine your financial sources generate new trade data (e.g., stock purchases/sales, loan applications, payment transactions) as they happen. These events can be immediately pushed to a Kafka topic.

How it connects: A separate producer (could be a simple script, an API, or even a Flink Kafka producer) would send these individual trade events to a Kafka topic like raw_transactions.

Live Market Data: If you have access to streaming market data (e.g., real-time stock prices, currency exchange rates), this could flow into another Kafka topic, say live_market_data.

Operational Logs/System Events: Logs from your trading systems, payment processors, or data ingestion services could be streamed to Kafka for real-time monitoring and anomaly detection.

2. Real-time Processing with Flink âš¡
Once data is in Kafka, Flink can consume these streams and perform real-time transformations, aggregations, or enrichments before the data is persisted or used.

Example Flink Operations:

Data Validation and Cleaning: As soon as a new financial transaction hits Kafka, Flink can:

Validate its schema and data types.

Clean dirty data (e.g., standardize currency codes, remove invalid entries).

Output: Validated and cleaned events could be written to a new Kafka topic (e.g., cleaned_transactions).

Data Enrichment:

Reference Data Join: For a transaction event, Flink can join it with static reference data (e.g., client information, product details loaded from a database or a file) to enrich the event in real-time.

Market Data Join: Join a trade event with the latest market data (from your live_market_data topic) to calculate profit/loss or assess impact at the moment of the trade.

Output: Enriched events pushed to enriched_transactions Kafka topic.

Real-time Aggregations/Analytics:

Windowed Aggregations: Calculate metrics like "total trade volume per minute," "average transaction size per hour," or "number of failed payments in the last 5 minutes." This provides immediate insights.

Fraud Detection: Implement simple rules or even machine learning models in Flink to flag suspicious patterns in real-time.

Output: Aggregated results or fraud alerts could be sent to different sinks, like another Kafka topic (realtime_metrics, fraud_alerts), a database, or directly to a monitoring dashboard.

Deduplication: Ensure that no duplicate events are processed and stored.

3. Integrating with Your Existing Pipeline and Tools ðŸ”—
This real-time processed data from Flink (now in new Kafka topics) can then feed your existing components:

DuckDB Warehouse: Flink can write its processed, cleaned, and enriched data (from topics like enriched_transactions or realtime_metrics) directly into your DuckDB warehouse. This means your warehouse would constantly receive fresh, real-time updates for downstream SQL transformations and analysis.

dbt: Your existing dbt models can then consume this real-time data from DuckDB for further batch transformations, or you could explore dbt's capabilities for streaming transformations if applicable.

Streamlit App: Your Streamlit app could be updated to:

Read from the processed Kafka topics directly for near-real-time dashboards.

Query the DuckDB warehouse, which is now receiving real-time data from Flink, to display more up-to-date information.

Airflow: Your Airflow DAG could be modified to:

Trigger periodic batch loads of the processed Kafka data into DuckDB (if not directly streamed by Flink).

Monitor the health of your Kafka topics and Flink jobs.

Backfill historical data if needed, while real-time data flows through Kafka/Flink.

By doing this, Kafka and Flink move beyond just a learning exercise and become integral components of a hybrid data architecture that combines the power of real-time streaming with batch processing and warehousing. This makes your project far more dynamic and capable of handling evolving financial data needs.
